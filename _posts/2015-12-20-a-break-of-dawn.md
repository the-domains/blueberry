# 

sparks in my eyes

ignite my bones

a fire roars at

the midnight of the world

a Testimony of pain

in three lines of blood

like a knife out of hand

was i more stranger than myself

as I chased my desire to control

the fire that roars at

the midnight of the world

rivers from the sky

pour like waterfalls

into my bones

spark my eyes

heal my broken stone

years and years of midnight

for just one break of dawn
