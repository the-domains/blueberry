# A Story of Many Songs (Book 1: Love)

I had a dream of a boy.

He was from Earth.

I am not.

He gave me an iPod.

I woke up holding an iPod.

I fell in love.

We had more dreams.

I would like to believe in this.

But I am out of time,

and they are after my life.

**Description**

In the storm

Of dust and flying trees

In the chaos

Of a people conflicted

Running to safety

The enemy has come

And I must find a way to leave

Can I leave behind all I have known?

I don't know how much

I can bear to lose

But I know this

Everything is about to change
