find me in the foreign direction 

watch me when the arrows fall from the sun 

twirl me around when I approach you 

laugh at me when I am wrong 

throw your love into my face like you hate me with all of your heart 

i want a wild look in your eyes 

i want a violent love 

drown my promises in black water and deep seas 

forgive me so hard the world flashes like a broken light 

find me in the foreign direction that I go 

wrap your arms around my neck until i can barely breathe 

make me run away and stop me with a knife 

let my blood drop to the dust look at me with fire

until I know this is real 

let it be violent 

let it be love

I honestly think of my dad whenever I come back to this, and the look in his eyes when I made that awesome mango/passion/avocado juice.
