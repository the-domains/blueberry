# Myla & Rhiannon
![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/7ea2df67-ed03-45db-a082-d9aff2fcaee6.jpg)

Without a doubt Rhiannon is already my favorite character in the series.

However, I also tremendously enjoy writing from Myla's perspective also!

They share a Katniss/Haymitch,
Harry/Dumbledore type relationship. 

Keep a lookout for other books in the series.
