# Oceans
![](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/e30e33685a7c757f52305828dc384be4bbc2a7d0.jpg)

There's something about the ocean.

About the vastness.

The waves.

The sheer power and the forces in the wind.

It's majestic.

And it's mysterious.

It's the perfect place to wonder.

And maybe even wander too.
