# Paramore - Last Hope (LIVE)

**Paramore** has been a huge inspiration for _A Story of Many Songs_. Watching this song, brought the story and the characters back to me.

Hayley Williams's sweet voice & high energy attitude, embodies the character of Sherri in the books! 

I think we need an illustration for Sherri too!
