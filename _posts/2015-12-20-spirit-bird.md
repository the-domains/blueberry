# spirit bird

long nights

with salty tears

the drumroll begins

on this road

our dreams commit suicide

come watch the spirit bird die

moaning owls

in the shadows

they hide their faces

they fly when they hear

the drumroll begin

this is the hour

that darkness hides in fear

the owls wings fold, they cry

come watch the spirit bird die

to my long nights

that have come and gone

all the tears

my life I cried

for the hour that

owls didn't sing their songs

i hold my hope for the day

____

the spirit bird shall rise
