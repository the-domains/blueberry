# The face of Myla?

While searching for the right image for the cover of _ASMS Book 2_ I was lucky enough to come across this photo by Demi Deherrera on [Unsplash.com][0]. 

It's not the same Myla I always imagined, but good enough to put on the cover. Besides, the photo doesn't reveal too much, which is ideal for me because I like leaving the rest to your imaginations. :-)
