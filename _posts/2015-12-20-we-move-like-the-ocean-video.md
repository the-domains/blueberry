# We Move Like The Ocean - Video

I hope Vagrant Records allows me to use the lyrics of this song by _Bad Suns_ in my novel, _Pain (ASMS Book 3)_. What a dream come true that would be!

_We Move Like The Ocean_ inspired a really special scene in the book. It felt almost magical to have written that scene while listening to the song and including some of the lyrics in it. 

_I pray, I pray._
