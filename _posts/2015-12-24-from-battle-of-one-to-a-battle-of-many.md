I hope for a successful collab sale next week. 

Looking for **10-20 people** to purchase ASMS Book 1 on amazon.ca

I'll be on the streets again, scouting for supporters

It's the first time working on this new sales strategy, God I hope it works out okay. If this goes well, my dreams may pretty much come true!
