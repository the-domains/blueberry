_i was never born to  
answer questions  
i am here to  
hear my footsteps crunch the snow  
as my toes cringe  
to the cold  
like icy water in my shoes  
- and that is not a question_

_i am here to see  
the crumpled leaves and twigs  
the squirrels scampering  
at the sound of my breath  
that condenses before my face  
- i speak not  
for a question_

_the chilly air sharpens the colors  
of my day  
until all is real  
and i cannot deny it  
and i am left with no hunger  
for thought_

_this is the answer i was  
that there is no purpose in life  
except life's perfect form  
and there is  
no purpose at all  
except my perfect form  
and this my body is free  
without a question_

_for it is God  
who made me_
