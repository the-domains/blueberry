## A Story of Many Songs (Series)

**Book 1: Love**
![I had a dream of a boy. He was from Earth. I am not. He gave me an iPod. I woke up holding an iPod. I fell in love. We had more dreams. I would like to believe in this. But I am out of time, and they are after my life.](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/8a325b60-840e-4112-95bb-d04079cf94ab.jpg)
