**What you sing about**

**when you become president?**

_Will you pimp a butterfly?_

_will you put me on display?_

_Will you tell Teagan her hair's too bushy?_

_Will you dome a nigga for being a nigga today?_

_Will you put a chain around a nigga_

_and tell him he will be okay? (Donald Williams Jr.)_

_Will__you hold up Keisha in a stretch?_

_Your hand conveniently behind her head_

_... No one knows Keisha_

_And Keisha knows no one..._

_Will you shackle a nigga for cashing his dough_

_Too much dough for a rapper nigga to own?_

_Back to back with Mr. Blac Youngsta_

_James Blake, you know how it goes_

**_What song you sing about when you become president?_**

Child of Earth you know how they look on you for your dark skin. Be careful not to do the same when you come across a blacker berry or a greener grape. White roses just as good as red ones. There ain't no need to discriminate. 

I trust you Child of Earth. I trust you will remember that we are all dust. And all dust is the same.
