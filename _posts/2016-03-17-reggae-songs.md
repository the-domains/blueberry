...wanna love you with reggae songs...

...wanna love you under a coconut tree

with beach sands falling off your back

while we hold cups of watermelon juice...

...wanna love you with salsa steps...

...wanna love you with maracas and drums...

...wanna love you with sushi rolls

and long walks in the night

with my tongue in your mouth...

...i wanna love you with my hand lost in your sea-salt sprayed hair

as you caress my avocado-washed dreads...

> OK, so there's this girl ... and reggae song is about this girl who I was thinking about while listening to reggae songs. And she makes me want to have watermelon juice with her.

_I like it when she touches my dreadlocks._

## News: an upcoming short story collection!

This poem will be included in my next short story collection:_A House Full of Rooms_

_I have a few poems and stories prepared already. I'm pretty excited about this project, my next collection after Oceans. It's taken a little while but I'm gathering more dust from farther places, older memories and crazier night dreams. I'm betting on these to turn into specks of magic._
