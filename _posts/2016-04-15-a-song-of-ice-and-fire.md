## Oceans: my life behind the story

# A song of ice and fire

#### The thing ice and fire have in common: they don't discriminate. You can be rich, poor, good or greedy, but a cold winter's day will be a cold winter's day. The wind won't ask for no resume. It will go ahead and bite right through you.

I sort of hated being out there in the cold, trying to sell a book. Knowing darn well most people don't wanna stay outside in weather like this.

I stood outside a red brick wall with my yellow poster taped to it. A poster that said:

**Oceans: This book is a dream. Read it like a dream.**  
**eBook - $3**  
**+ Audiobook - $5**  
**+ Author Commentary - $7**

I kept thinking how if it wasn't for my debt, I probably wouldn't be battling out in the harsh weather. I thought maybe if I hadn't lost my job so unexpectedly, I would have been more financially prepared with my life. I heard the voices of some of my friends, telling me to get a real job, swirling in my head. Like, hell you think I'm doing?  
Another passerby walks by me with nothing but a glance. Minimal recognition.

### I didn't make much money that day.

I went home, depressed, knowing I had to change something. But I wasn't sure what. I stared at the yellow poster I made for a while. I didn't enjoy pouring out my heart in a project like this, and standing out in cold winds to receive nothing in return for my labor. I didn't like the weight of debt on my shoulders. I didn't like the fact that half if not all the money I would make, would go to paying it off.

I went looking for answers. But I wasn't sure where to go. That night I opened my Bible and read a story about Samson. Unintentionally of course. I was looking for solace late that night. In the story, Samson teases the Philistines with a riddle and they spend at least 3 days trying to figure it out. And I stopped and wondered how a riddle could hold someone's attention for so long?

**Samson's riddle:**

> "Out of the eater came something to eat,  
> Out of the strong came something sweet"

**(Answer: What is sweeter than honey? What is stronger than a lion?)**

The next day I took a lesson from the story and fashioned my own riddle.

> "Out of the water, came a light  
> In your hands, you held the ice"

I wrote it on a neon green sign and held it up. I was back on the cold streets, trying to make a buck with something that I made in my bedroom. In a few minutes, someone stopped by who had read the riddle and was curious about what the answer was. She tried to guess it but she got it wrong.

She saw the yellow poster on the wall behind me and I took the chance to talk to her about my book. Moments later I had made the first sale of my day for the audiobook and I was set to do it again.

The days got colder. And sometimes I had to step inside building lobbies for a minute or two to keep warm, before returning to the ice-cold air. My gloves were thin. A woman commented that I should dress more warmer. I didn't mind. I loved being out on the streets. I loved getting people's attention and watching them try to solve my riddle. I loved to talk about my story and sell it. I loved being able to lose my job and still pay some debt off by talking to strangers outside.

I loved every place I was told to leave, because they couldn't have me sharing my story outside their property. I loved getting free lunch from a generous man who seemed to have many questions about God and religion. I loved it when my fingers froze and my feet felt like I had ice in between my toes.

#### Because a cold winter's day will be a cold winter's day, whether you like it or not. It will go ahead and bite right through you. But I'm alright. I got tough skin. I've been through tougher times.
