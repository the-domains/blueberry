I was walking home one cold night. And 

the cold was freezing my toes and the 

trees were quiet. I heard laughter from 

the houses on the block. A friend of 

mine walked past me but didn't notice 

me. I called her out but she did not turn 

back. 

So I looked ahead and saw the road 

climb up in a hill, I had quite a way 

home. Nothing interesting happened that 

night, I wished something did. I guess 

that's why I wrote this book, among 

many other reasons, because I want each 

part of my life to be interesting. 

This is a sincere book. The oceans in 

here have flowed for years and across 

continents. The waters have rained from 

the highest clouds and dripped into the 

deepest caverns. 

Turn the page and wander...

Kaleidoscope 

!

I saw five houses. And the five houses 

came together to form one large house. 

And I marveled at this. So I walked into 

the large house. And as soon as I closed 

the door behind me, the large house split 

into five houses again. 

And I looked out the window and I 

saw the streets and the trees from five 

angles at the same time, like a 

kaleidoscope. And when I walked on the 

pink carpet I felt my feet walking over 

five carpets, five times, at the same time. 

I became dizzy from this confusion and 

my body which was in five places felt like 

fainting. 

So I looked back and saw five doors of 

the five different houses and I started to 

run towards the door in front of me, 

which was also five doors at the same 

time. 

When I came out of the house, I came 

out of five, and I saw everything from 

ten eyes because I was five people. 

Again, I was very confused, but now I 

saw the world differently. 

I saw the five houses as if they were 

different sides of one and I saw the trees 

and the streets as if they were five. And 

the birds seemed to fly around me five 

times and the sky was in five pieces. 

I stood still and marveled at how my 

world had changed from this experience. 

I turned to myself and saw myself 

looking back at myself and saw my two 

selves looking at each other while my 

other self watched me and my other self 

noticed I was watching myself and the 

my first two selves saw that we noticed 

ourselves two times at once, and my fifth 

self marveled at my other four selves 

that all saw the fifth self four times at 

once. 

And I saw a man walking beside me, 

carrying a grey/blue rectangular frame. 

And when he saw me, he gave me the 

frame and said that I should climb into 

it. And when I did, I stepped into my 

former world and I was separated from 

my other four selves that could not climb 

into the frame. And I felt free from the 

confusion. 

My other four selves were sad that they 

could not join me in my original world. 

They said goodbye and ran back into the 

five houses. I never saw them again. 

When I went home I put the frame the 

man gave me around my mirror. And 

each time I see myself I feel happy that 

there is no one who is like me. I am 

happy for my quirks and I don't post my 

selfies on twitter, Facebook, Snapchat 

and Instagram like I did before.

smiling by yourself 

in a room all alone 

thinking of a song you heard 

a few months ago 

when all your thoughts were 

simple then 

reminding yourself 

that you are special 

as you sing along to freedom 

i think the lines went something like: 

it comes back to you 

it comes back to you 

all the things you had lost 

will find their way to you 

and you don't understand why 

you suddenly remembered this song 

are you anything greater now 

than you were then? 

or have you returned to 

what you were 

before everything after 

that song began? 

like the months in between suddenly 

vanished into irrelevance 

perhaps, all this is 

also irrelevant once 

you hear this song again 

while you sit on a bus 

riding your way home 

at the night 

your head against the window 

as you tire 

and sing along 

your days winding past you 

like the blur of traffic 

passing before your eyes 

but your thoughts have rested 

in the irrelevance of the pattern 

it's almost as if you were 

scanning the city lights but 

waiting for something else 

something much more important 

to come back to you again

how long?

a slow day to see 

a long night it must have been 

another heavy burden 

to carry in this heart 

feet become heavy 

with every step you take 

how long, you ask the moon 

how long, you ask the clouds 

how long, you ask the trees 

how long, you ask the walls 

how long, you ask the wind 

how long, you ask the sun 

how long, you ask the shadows 

that move about you 

how long, you ask the night 

how long, you ask the cold 

how long, you ask the star 

how long, you ask the light 

how long, you ask yourself 

as you return to bed that night 

a slow day it was 

and the burden in your heart 

only sinks deeper 

you didn't even know it could 

go that deep 

how long, you turn off the light 

how long, you close your eyes 

how long, you ask 

how long, no one answers 

how long, you cry 

how long, you think you're insane 

how long, you think you're stupid 

how long, you sleep 

how long, you wake up 

and it's right there where you left it

can I love you out of joy 

can I love you, wanting nothing 

in return 

can I love you pure, and honest 

can I love all of you 

why do you worry 

about many things 

about me? 

i just love you 

it lights my eyes 

don't you see 

this is my joy 

i am not giving you 

a responsibility to not break me 

i am not asking you 

for anything 

i thought I was clear 

i love you and it brings me joy 

and laughter 

and I laugh on my bed 

it feels like years of pleasure 

i am not wanting 

and I am not lacking 

you can walk away 

and leave me alone 

why do you worry? 

it's not important 

my love is free and not for gain 

if I showed you who I was 

you would truly be scared 

i'm frighteningly beautiful 

my love is never fair 

don't worry that you 

have failed to adore me 

i love you with joy and laughter 

and that is all there is

foaming from the storm of life. washing 

over me. an ocean of despair. is quicker 

than me. weighing me down. like the air 

is thicker than iron. 

too many times I seen the end. 

too many dates I shared with fate. 

a thousand days I died to escape. 

a thousand days of love's mistake. 

a storm of many dreams. a whipping 

wind for a kite. a singular desire to break. 

from freedom, fear and night. heard 

water can change everything about this 

place. even a kite, tattered in dark rain, 

lost like the stranded prism above my 

head. flickering from a false light of 

truth. into an endless wander for ocean's 

mercy. redemption, and maybe some life.

I saw myself falling from the sky. I 

landed on a rock, in the middle of the 

sea. The waves rushed against it, 

splashing my back. Roaring at me like it 

did not appreciate my presence. The 

water was cold and my body did not like 

it. At first I was too enthralled by where 

I was to be bothered by the waters. I saw 

the blanket that covers the skyline, the 

velvet night, sprinkled with stars and 

woven with dark clouds. 

Beyond where I was stood a 

lighthouse, tall and elegant with a beam 

of light, sweeping the seas. It crossed 

over the lands and the waters, it grazed 

the stars behind me, and landed on me. 

And that's when the world opened up. 

Like a river of light, and I was in the 

water in an instant. Bathing and 

thrusting my arms in the warm sea. The 

sunrise behind the orange cliff, like a red 

lava trapped in a ball of life. And I knew 

I was leaving. I felt it. I didn't know 

where I was going to go. I was abducted 

in a wave of joy that filled me up, like an 

overflowing cup. All my heart could feel 

it. All my body was glad for it. 

When the sea did not move and the 

light froze, I woke up and I just knew I 

had to tell you all about the lighthouse. It 

is there.

OCEANS II

When I was standing on the rock, I 

thought of where I came from and felt a 

rush of memories. A melancholy 

brimming through my eyes. Like a dust 

gathering at the bottom of the sea, 

stirring up old things that I don't like to 

remember. Like the things I lost and 

never knew I was supposed to have. My 

body that grew anxious from fighting so 

many battles. 

And the stars spoke to me, and their 

voices were all around me. "Why do you 

worry about your past? What harm can it 

do to you?" 

I said to the stars, "The past is not 

forgotten. It lives in your body and hides 

under your skin. It does not leave you. 

You wouldn't understand. Your past and 

present are the same. You've always been 

light, you have never been darkness." 

And the stars said, "We are light. But 

we hang in the dark void. This is our 

penalty to bring pleasure to the eyes of 

those who walk on the earth. When you 

shine in your darkness you will also be a 

pleasure." 

"A pleasure to who? I don't believe 

anyone loves me. They love me for what 

I do with my hands, but not for what I 

do with my heart. And I am broken and 

have no strength to shine anymore." 

And then the mountains spoke. And 

their voice was loud and pierced my 

body with vibrations. Their voice 

covered me like a shadow. "Do you think 

mankind loves me for my heart? They 

look at me and see my great height and 

my many rocks and valleys. If I was not 

so large they would not care any less." 

And I told the mountains, "What heart 

do you have? You only do the things you 

were made to do. Nothing more. And 

they love you for that. As for me, I am 

made this way, and I am not loved like 

you. You don't know what it's like to 

walk this earth. You have only sat in one 

place. You are like the stars. You have no 

contrast." 

And the mountain replied, "I may not 

move but I see the world from the sky 

and I have heard your kind speak. I have 

watched your kind kill and marry, heal 

and destroy. Perhaps you will find joy 

when you become like me and the stars, 

when you sit down in one place and 

rest." 

And I said, "You are a mighty rock but 

you have no wisdom and no answers. 

You see but you don't understand. When 

did you ever feel desire? When did you
