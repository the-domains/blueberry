# Love Is

Love is my security

Love is a friend

Love is faithful

Love will bend for you

Love is my high wall

Love is my stairs

Love is the fruit of the highest branch

Love is the person who carries you there

Love is the sea

Love is the boat that sails you across

Love is the bouts of laughter

And the moments of silence shared

Love is God

And God is love

Love is true

Love is the greatest of all
