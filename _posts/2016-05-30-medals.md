You look back at your past

Like a river that flows down from you

And you see wisdom and courage

You see your battles won and your greatest triumphs

But then you turn ahead and faint in your heart

And you wonder if you still have what it takes

Child of earth, listen up!

It wasn't any easier then

Than it is now

We only see looking back

Looking forward requires risks and faith

Because we walk on the paths of the unknown

But the moments of reminisce are full of light

not to show you that you were better before

But to give you hope that you can carry on

Do not use your victories against yourself

And fail to move on because you feel

You are not the same

> "Child of earth, your past is your walk of fame. Your memories are your medals"
