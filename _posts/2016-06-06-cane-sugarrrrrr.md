You fill me like water from the coconut

You sweet sweet

Look atchu!

You make my days so sweet sweet

I got this sugar high

I might never come down

You're my cane sugar

> "Babe, gimme a hand cause I got my head off the ground!"

I got this sugar high, mellow on this sugar thrill

I lost my mind to you

hope you put it next to the heart I gave you

Get me that watermelon, babe

And sit your ass down beside me

See the sun chase the moon

And talk about our lives, baby

And how you got me 

High on my days so sweet sweet

I might never come down

You're my cane sugar

So come lie down

One two three, and you're here

And you're with me

One two three, I love you

And you need me

Take it off, let me see ya sweet sweet

We are made from dust

But he made you from the sugar

Can't complain, my urge to run my tongue up

the curves and the bones 

and sweet kiss ya

Look at my eyes, stubborn-ass girl, when I reach ya

We got so far off the ground

You got that coconut from the highest tree

You might never come down

From the way you loving me

## Mhh, mhhhhhhhhhhhh!!

From the way you loving me

With that Latina love

From the way you make room

and make time for me

From the way you stay down for me

From the way you laugh with me

From the way you stare at me

and rub my dreads and my back

You're a product of the sugar

and the star dust,

More parts sugar,

Aint nobody else sweet enough

> "You make me think of an island and just the two of us"

> "You're dreaming babe!"

> "I know its fantasy thoughts but babe that's what the sugar does!"

Oh, high on my days so sweet sweet

I'm high on my life so sweet sweet

High in the late night so sweet sweet

High in the morning like sweet sweet

You know I've been telling all my boys

You just so sweet sweet
