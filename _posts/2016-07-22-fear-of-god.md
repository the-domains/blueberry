# Fear of God

_God I am crushed in this world and in this life_

_Because the devil roams around as a roaring lion,_

_Seeking whom he may devour_

_My family is broken and so am I_

_I am hurt and so are they_

_And these things Father, they follow me even after_

_I have run away_

_God for this case what do I do?_

...

But break me, until I am no longer stubborn

Until I no longer remember pains of my past

Break me till I am your fearful slave

Who clings to you and not my pains

Break me until the love in my heart is as deep as yours

To swallow all the offenses that have come against me

That I may love them as you would have me do

Without remembrance of the former things

or the fear of being hurt

For I fear one thing only: to be disobedient to You

who loves me
