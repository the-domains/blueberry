_I see light beams over
ocean crests_

_Am I the only nigga tryna levitate_

_Am I the only nigga who can see the sun_

_like a pancake_

_The lighthouse is here, y'all come see the way_

_Eat all you want, this your mama's weekend bake_

I see wise words flying
out of rainbows

Lyrics to my songs, prayers to my God

I think I can rise, can you see my fly

Like a black boy fly, you tell em Kendrick

A big black bird in the sky, don't shoot it

And if you try, im immune to the bullets

Im all the way up, got
angels on my guard up

Hell you think I pray for, no blessings stop

I levitate so high, like a church choir turnt up

Don't lie to me now, aint got no time for this now

I know the truth when I see it, 

I pray for it and take it

I toldya I see light beams over ocean crests

I started from rocks and
rags,

I already got more than the riches

If you a vanity slave you cant feel it

Your waters too shallow for my kinda feeling

Your rivers too dry for my kinda living

You a slave to this paper? 

Do you buy and sell your life to retailers?

Don't know who you are but you aint my kinda dealer

I only ride with people who know where they go

If u aint got no drive, where the hell you gon' go?

Stack your digits: only thing you can show

But I got more life and passion than you can sow

Told the world goodbye, gonna boss my life

My self-esteem aint for sale anymore

_I see light beams over
ocean crests_

_Am I the only nigga tryna levitate?_

_Am I the only nigga who can see the sun_

_like a pancake_

_The juice is in the juicebox_

_If yu wanna dance then come with the juke-box_

I got a bad girl beside me

Make sure you pray for your girl

Make sure you hold it down for your girl

She's about that la vida loca,

But im tryna give her the world

> The lighthouse is here,
> y'all come see the way. 
> 
> Eat all you want, this
> your mama's weekend bake

You can bank all you want
but you cant escape

Sooner or later you're gonna sit by these banks

And you gonna start to meditate 

my words are like seeds, they sit and they grow

if you're still reading this you might grow an afro

I don't write lyrics and I don't write poems

My girl's girl calls them lyrims

Imma roll with what they say

I see ocean crests rise

You better learn how to levitate

_The lighthouse is here,
y'all come see the way_

_Eat all you want, this your mama's weekend bake_

> Am I the only nigga tryna
> levitate?

...

The sun is a pancake, if you can rise high enough to see it. Now, that might not be your taste, but, Child of Earth, when the ocean crests rise, you're just gonna have to learn to meditate.
