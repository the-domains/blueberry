Coffee beans, coffee beans

Mans tryna get on top of me

Calling me a monkey, see

Blak soul, blak like a coffee tree

Please don't take my coffee beans

...

Blak don't crack my nigga who you talking to?

There's power in the holy tree

That's why starbucks is on her pedestal

blak just wants her coffee beans

this flow is heading tropical

rising from the coastline

my head in a pineapple

got a few words for the spectator

Blak sweat aint your popsicle

Blak never was black

Till a blak hater invented it

Fair trade wasn't free

For money trees they incentive it

...

Under five cents per cup, she pay

What happened to one denari a day?

Melusine, you wont get many black friends that way

Melusine, you don't wanna see us that way

Melusine, dont crack the back again

Yeah, blak do crack under the heavier hand

Blak will crack a few times out of ten

But blak will rise on the coastline again

Spittin in the dust, my face up in the sun

My mind in another place when I begun

Check this next verse, and tell me if Im the one:

too content to consume content, my time costs rent

I assume overconsumption must leave you contempt

I write about things you dont understand

Now find the dollar signs in my next rant:

The sun is orange, it's bleeding pink

I am not modern but I stay lit

My lyrics aren't conscious, they're intentional

Head in a mango, my tropical flow is lyrical

I believe in fruits and nuts,

but don't take my coffee beans

I keep my hands in the dirt

To rescue my heritage

In my last verse I confess, Im not black

I don't consume labels, never understood that

I grow dreadlocks, so I don't forget my roots

I keep them free-form, my hair will tell me the truth

Ma girl rubs her hands in with the castor

Feeling so sweet, can we rub any faster?

ingredients: peanut butter, banana, avocado 

you'll never get this from commercials

couldn't deal with shampoo and conditioner

lab chemicals: the purpose appeared commercial

yeah, im a natural, aint embarrassed to admit it

I can eat what I put on my skin, I might be a realist

Im passionate about time, I save as much of it

you love making art, but do you love being an artist

tired of people talking about how they be the one

I bet every other star tried to be the sun

Know what, I aint even tryna be the one

Take your judgement home, this m.A.A.d city I run

I'll keep my shoes on, I'll dance when I want

I'll have my coconut, represent where I from

If you saw the dollar signs, then you've finally understood

Help me bring the coffee beans back to the hood

My mind in a different place from when I begun

But my locks got me rooted, hear my next song:

_Blak is ripe, blak is gold, blak is black without a c. Black is a label, black is a color. Blak is black without the color, see? Blak is a mirror, blak is freedom, blak is hope, black is smoke. black is black, but blak is dope. too young for the future, but too old for the past. The history of Africa belongs to the blak man._

_The blaker your scripts, the darker the past. tropical flow: aint no time to relapse, the hotter the mic gets the harder it drops, the hotter the bars get the bigger the punch, Jesus said turn the other cheek, now you know who is the one._
