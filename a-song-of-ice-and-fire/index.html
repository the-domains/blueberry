<p>I sort of hated being out there in the cold, trying to sell a book. Knowing darn well most people don’t wanna stay outside in weather like this.</p><p>I stood outside a red brick wall with my yellow poster taped to it. A poster that said:</p><p><strong>Oceans: This book is a dream. Read it like a dream.</strong><br><strong>eBook - $3</strong><br><strong>+ Audiobook - $5</strong><br><strong>+ Author Commentary - $7</strong></p><picture>

<p>I kept thinking how if it wasn’t for my debt, I probably wouldn’t be battling out in the harsh weather. I thought maybe if I hadn’t lost my job so unexpectedly, I would have been more financially prepared with my life. I heard the voices of some of my friends, telling me to get a real job, swirling in my head. Like, hell you think I’m doing?<br>Another passerby walks by me with nothing but a glance. Minimal recognition.</p><h3>I didn’t make much money that day.</h3><p>I went home, depressed, knowing I had to change something. But I wasn’t sure what. I stared at the yellow poster I made for a while. I didn’t enjoy pouring out my heart in a project like this, and standing out in cold winds to receive nothing in return for my labor. I didn’t like the weight of debt on my shoulders. I didn’t like the fact that half if not all the money I would make, would go to paying it off.</p><p>I went looking for answers. But I wasn’t sure where to go. That night I opened my Bible and read a story about Samson. Unintentionally of course. I was looking for solace late that night. In the story, Samson teases the Philistines with a riddle and they spend at least 3 days trying to figure it out. And I stopped and wondered how a riddle could hold someone’s attention for so long?</p><p><strong>Samson’s riddle:</strong></p><blockquote><p>“Out of the eater came something to eat,<br>Out of the strong came something sweet”</p></blockquote><p><strong>(Answer: What is sweeter than honey? What is stronger than a lion?)</strong></p><p>The next day I took a lesson from the story and fashioned my own riddle.</p><blockquote><p>“Out of the water, came a light<br>In your hands, you held the ice”</p></blockquote><p>I wrote it on a neon green sign and held it up. I was back on the cold streets, trying to make a buck with something that I made in my bedroom. In a few minutes, someone stopped by who had read the riddle and was curious about what the answer was. She tried to guess it but she got it wrong.</p><p>She saw the yellow poster on the wall behind me and I took the chance to talk to her about my book. Moments later I had made the first sale of my day for the audiobook and I was set to do it again.</p><picture>

<p>The days got colder. And sometimes I had to step inside building lobbies for a minute or two to keep warm, before returning to the ice-cold air. My gloves were thin. A woman commented that I should dress more warmer. I didn’t mind. I loved being out on the streets. I loved getting people’s attention and watching them try to solve my riddle. I loved to talk about my story and sell it. I loved being able to lose my job and still pay some debt off by talking to strangers outside.</p><p>I loved every place I was told to leave, because they couldn’t have me sharing my story outside their property. I loved getting free lunch from a generous man who seemed to have many questions about God and religion. I loved it when my fingers froze and my feet felt like I had ice in between my toes.</p><h4>Because a cold winter’s day will be a cold winter’s day, whether you like it or not. It will go ahead and bite right through you. But I’m alright. I got tough skin. I’ve been through tougher times.</h4></div></article></section></div><section id="3" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-white colors-local " data-reactid="54"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="55"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="56"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="57"><span data-reactid="58"><!-- react-empty: 59 --><h2 data-reactid="60"><a data-reactid="61">blueberry</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="62"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="63"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="64"></div></div></div><div data-reactid="65"></div></section></div></div>
